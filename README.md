This app allows the user to record when and where (if location permissions have been granted) a Bluetooth device is connected or disconnected.

The aim of this app is twofold:
1. Find out where you left your earphones. Or at least, close enough.
2. Help developers test the reliability of Bluetooth connections.

If location permission is denied, the app will still record events and timestamps.

* No MAC addresses are sent to any servers.
* The Internet permission is needed to display the maps.
