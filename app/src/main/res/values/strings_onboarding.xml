        This application keeps track of bluetooth connection and disconnection events on the device.
        \n
        \nIf location access is granted it will also show where the event took place, which is handy if you are trying to find a lost device.

        In order to display a map showing where an event took place you need to grant location access.
        \nOn Android 10+ (Q) devices, you also need to allow location access when the app is in the background.
        \nIf you don\'t grant access the app will still record bluetooth events.
